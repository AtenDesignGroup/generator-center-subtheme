# generator-center-subtheme [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AtenDesignGroup/generator-center-subtheme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AtenDesignGroup/generator-center-subtheme)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

If you don't have Yeoman installed yet, run the following.

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-center-subtheme from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-center-subtheme
```

Create a directory for your new theme. The following assumes you are running the commands from the root of your Drupal project.

```bash
mkdir sites/all/themes/my_new_theme
cd sites/all/themes/my_new_theme
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo center-subtheme
```

The generator will prompt you for a theme name and description then scaffold out a new theme.
